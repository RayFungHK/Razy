# Razy v0.4.4

**Build 219** | October 2024

Transitional release preparing for v0.5 — introduced `Route` entity, execution method tracking, and groundwork for module activation via CLI.

---

## Build 219 (2024-10-15)

### Additions

- Added execution method tracking and `Controller::getExecuteMethod()` to identify how the controller method was called
- Distributor added call flow tracking of controller methods
- Added `Route` entity to configure more complex routing and store data during the routing stage
- Added new event `Controller::__onEntry()` — executes after all modules have dispatched
- Statement's `ORDER BY` now supports array with syntax
- Added `Validate::getValueByName()`, `Validate::getValue()`, and `Validate::setValue()`

### Changes

- Now Razy requires **PHP >= 8.2**
- Ready for **v0.5** — modules will no longer auto-enable; each module must be activated and installed via CLI (or `enable-all` command)
- Ready for APCu support — speed up the system using memory storage

### Fixes

- Fixed `Action::submit()` assigning incorrect column to `ON DUPLICATE UPDATE` syntax (carried from build 220 commit)
